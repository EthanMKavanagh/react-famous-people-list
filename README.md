# Famous People App (Part 2)

Let's extend our Famous People App to allow for a list of famous people!

> Build off your earlier application or start with the code provided here.

## Required Features

- Add a `people` array to the FamousPeople Component's state to keep track of all the famous people.
- Modify the initial display of the single person to show a bullet list of everyone in the `people` array.
- When the Submit button is clicked, add the new famous person to the `people` array. This should update the list shown.

### Components
 - Split the FamousPerson Component into 3 Components:
  - a FamousPersonForm (to add a new person)
  - a FamousPersonList (to display each person in the array)
  - a FamousPerson (to display the original famous person's info as *'Felicia Day is famous for "The Guild".* (Use `<span>` to wrap the text.)
